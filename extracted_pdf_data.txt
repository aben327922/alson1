Comparison of cooling seasonal power consumption 
based on average CSPF values
Inverter air conditioner can adjust its cooling capacity 
according to the cooing load .this is less power consumption.
In response to ﬂuctuating cooling  load, Non inverter air 
conditioners  repeatedly perform  ON(full-power)/OFF 
(zero-power) operation. Inverter air conditioners, however, 
operate at optimal cooling capacity according to the cooling 
load .since inverter air conditioners provide required minimum 
cooling capacity with minimum  electrical power , total power 
consumption can be reduced during cooling period
Inverters operate without repeated On/Oﬀ operation
Continuous driving without stopping and starting is more 
fuel eﬃcient.
When temperature does not ﬂuctuate muchthe set temperature is maintained.
Quickly and easily make space comfortable before the arrival of oﬃce workers or shop customers. As well as quick 
cooling at max. CapacityĠ

Inverter control responds to load changes and causes minor temperature adjustments. On-inverter control frequently 
turns ON and OFF in response to load ﬂuctuations or load mismatch and causes large temperature swings.
Constantly stopping and starting consumes energy and 
is less fuel eﬃcient.

easy to hang outside the wall , also less cost on the 
outdoor unit stands in low side.

It is convenient that Installer can connect the software to 
PCB  port  to check all running data (the same as current 
super match monitor software)
Data & error code can be checked which is convenient for 
installer;
Installer can check outdoor unit data  (including 
compressor/motor/EEV/module/sensor)  from dip switch 
in PCB , installer can make easy work;
For the indoor outdoor connection , we takes ﬂared 
connection , not welding connection , which is easier and 
quicker than traditional duct installation
High Height Drop 50m which is ﬂexible for long piping

There is no crack from the ﬂap and the panel when the 
air conditioner oﬀ.More elegance .
The 360°smart ﬂow cassette have particular hidden LCD 
display design. Green display for cooling red display for 
heating, it is very easy identiﬁed by opening mode.
ABS material makes the panel  “piano white ” ,  diﬀerent 
from “ dark  white” PS material color.The panel and ﬂap 
are the same material. After  10 years , the panel  color 
won’ t  change to yellow color because the   ABS  
material prevents discoloration against light raying.
Compared to conventional air inlet grill, we enlarge the 
air inlet area by 23%, lower air speed & lower the sound 
level. 
The diameter of new fan is enlarged based on 
acrodynamic theory, so that there is the least resistance 
against airﬂow. Reduce 3dB(A) for sound level.
Besides  3 normal speeds  we  set one extra least fan 
speed .totally 4 speeds .Sound level  reduce 3 dB extra.

When defrosting of indoor unit is completed, it enters into outdoor unit self-cleaning process. As for cooling only units, 
the fan blows the wind reversely to remove the dust for self-cleaning.  As for heat pump units, if ambient temperature 
is higher than the set temperature, the fan blows the wind reversely to remove the dust; if ambient temperature is 
lower than the set temperature, the unit will carry out the self-cleaning by four steps: dust removal, condensation, 
frosting and defrosting.

Outdoor fan blows
wind reversely to
eliminate some dust
on the condenser.
Condenser’s temperature
is decreased for
condensation, and
water droplets and dust
are combined together
The condenser is
cooled quickly, the dew
will be frosted and then
the dust is separated
from the fins.
Increase the
temperature for
defrosting; the 
condensate water will
take away the dust.

Efficient and Energy Saving 
Well equipped with G-Boost inverter compressor and single-

Air Supply Temperature Down to 8°C
Less Heat for More Pleasure
Even under T3 working condition (fan is at low speed), the air outlet temperature of the indoor unit can be as low as 
8°C, bringing the ultimate cooling pleasure to you.
It is a technical breakthrough of the inverter compressor. Compared with the conventional compressor, the single unit 
capacity is increased by 9.6%~14.5% and the energy efficiency is increased by 2.4%~8%.  
It is annoying that the evaporator is very easy to accumulate dust and bacteria. While Gree evaporator Self Clean 
Technology adopts five steps of “condensation, frosting, defrosting, drying and 50-55°C sterilization” to keep the 
evaporator clean for fresh air supply.

Colasma Air Purification Technology 
The cold plasma device generates positive and negative ions to kill the bacteria and then decompose them into water, 
making fresh air for you
Sterilize and Purify The Air
As one of the effective ways to deal with indoor air pollution, Colasma can effectively remove bacteria and kill viruses, 
such as coronavirus, influenza virus, rotavirus, bacillus, coccus and molds.
According to the tests carried out by an authoritative testing institution, ion release exceeds 300X104n/cm 3 and the 
removal rate of air floating microorganisms is more than 93% in one hour./.null
Remove Odor and Inhibit Static Electricity
Because the number of negative ions is greater than that of positive ions, the excess negative ions floating in the air 
may additionally remove unpleasant odors inevitable in daily life, such as smell of cigarette and smell of toilet. 
Besides, it can reduce static electricity so that pollen and dust is not easy to attach to curtains and clothing.

The release of cooling capacity can be reasonably controlled by selecting appropriate electric power according to the 
using environment. While enjoying the pleasure brought by air conditioning, it can reduce consumption, save energy, 
and reduce unnecessary waste of resources.
Power Gear Control
It is a perfect AC that provides not only comfortable cooling but also reliable operation and power saving function. It 
has been upgraded with a new function of energy control which is suitable for places with power limitation, power 
shortage, etc. While reducing power consumption, AC can still operate reliably and stably under different power input.
This is an AC designed with 3 selections of power modes for reducing energy consumption.
